Looma first light
-----------------

When you connect Looma for the first time, Looma is waiting for Wf-Fi credentials. Once connected with a power supply through the USB-C port, Looma will boot in 
Access Point Mode (AP Mode). In this Mode, Looma broadcasts its own Wi-Fi network with type LOOMA-XXXXXXX as shown below.
The colored ring is lighting with beautiful rainbow colors.

Now, you have to connect your mobile, tablet or computer to this network and go to http://192.168.4.1/ with your favorite browser. Great !
You should be able to see the page below.
You can type the SSID and the password of your network and also give an additionnal fallback Wi-Fi network. If the main network becomes unavailble, Looma will try to connect
to the second network.

Once credentials has been saved, Looma restarts and try to connect to the main Wi-Fi network (or Wi-Fi fallback network if main Wi-Fi is unavailable).

Be patient, this could take a long time. You'll see purple spinner or blue fade in and out ring during the update.
Looma may restart several times during the update process.

Once Looma has been update, the colored ring should be off after having blinking three times in green. The displayed page looks like the screen capture below.
